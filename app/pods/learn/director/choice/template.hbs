<p>Throughout the game, you might want to present the player with menu-style choices. These choices could range from responses in conversation to multiple choice list of destinations at a bus stop. The <code class="inline-code">choice</code> direction presents players with a list of choices and returns a promise containing the value of their choice. The list of choices can be navigated with <code class="inline-code">ArrowUp</code> and <code class="inline-code">ArrowDown</code> keys, and some choices can be made inputable, so that when they are clicked, they transform into input fields.</p>
