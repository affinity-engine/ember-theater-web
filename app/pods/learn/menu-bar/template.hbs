<p>The load button opens a menu from which the player can load a previous save.</p>

<h2><code class="inline-code">ember-theater/menu-bar/reset</code></h2>

<p>The reset button returns the player to the very beginning of the game.</p>

<h2><code class="inline-code">ember-theater/menu-bar/rewind</code></h2>
