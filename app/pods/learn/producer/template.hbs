<h1>The Producer</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Ember Theater wants to give you as much freedom as possible while developing your game, while still providing you with a powerful toolset. We make this possible by bundling features into high-level components, which you can then opt into. This allows you to pick, choose, and combine the right toolsets for your needs. The producer is responsible for managing these high-level components.</p>

<p>To tell the producer to use a component, open <code class="inline-code">app/ember-theater/config.js</code> and add the components' path like so:</p>

{{code-snippet name="learn--producer--config.js"}}

<p>Ember Theater supports several of these packages, which are documented in detail in the {{#link-to "learn.director"}}Director{{/link-to}} and {{#link-to "learn.menu-bar"}}Menu Bar{{/link-to}} sections.</p>

<p>You can also create and use your own producer components, and even share your components with the Ember Theater community.</p>
