<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>Creating an Ember Project</h3>

<p>Before starting your first Ember Theater project, you'll need to ensure that you have Ember CLI installed. You can find an excellent guide <a href="https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.2.0/getting-started/" target="_blank">here</a>. You'll only have to go through this process once.</p>

<p>Once Ember CLI is installed, you can create as many projects as you like. To start a project, simply enter <code>ember new [project name]</code> in your terminal.</p>

<h3>Installing the Ember Theater addon</h3>

<p>Within your project folder, type <code>ember install ember-theater</code>. NPM will now start downloading Ember Theater. This can take a few minutes.</p>

<p>While the addon is installing, you can complete the next steps. First, navigate to <code>ember-cli-build.js</code> and modify <code>EmberAddon</code> to include these lines:</p>

{{code-snippet name="guides--installation--ember-cli-build.js"}}

<p>Next, go to <code>app/controllers/application.js</code> (if necessary, create the file) and modify it to import your Ember Theater config:</p>

{{code-snippet name="guides--installation--application.js"}}

<p>Finally, navigate to <code>app/templates/application.hbs</code> and enter <code>&#123;&#123;ember-theater config=config&#125;&#125;</code>.</p>

<h3>Running the dev environment</h3>

<p>Once you have the Ember project setup, you can start the dev environment by running <code>ember server</code> in your command line. After that, navigate to <a href="http://localhost:4200/" target="_blank">http://localhost:4200</a> to see the game in action.</p>
