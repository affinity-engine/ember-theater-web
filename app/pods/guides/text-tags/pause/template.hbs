<h3><code>pause</code></h3>

<p>When the <code>pause</code> text tag is encountered, it pauses the text. As soon as the player presses a continue key (which ever keys they press to normally advance the text), text will resume printing. It optionally accepts a duration, after which the text will resume printing automatically.</p>
