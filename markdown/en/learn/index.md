# Ember Theater

Welcome to Ember Theater! These guides will show you how to use the `ember-theater` addon to build ambitious web games using the Ember.js framework. Along the way, you'll encounter both exhaustive API documentation and simple, user-friendly demos. We wrote these docs to be as approachable as possible, but there's also a wealth of information for those who wish to dive deeper and get the most out of the Ember Theater game engine.

## A Word of Warning

Getting Ember Theater setup can be a big process, and if you've never worked with the command line before, it'll also require you to interface with your computer in a new and challenging way. The upswing is that Ember Theater is built with incredibly powerful tools, and it extends that power to make game design that much easier for you. Although the setup might be daunting, bear with it and you'll have a simple, extensible, and highly customizable game engine at your disposal.
