## Using the Command line

If you've never used the command line before (or you need a refresher), you might want to check out one of these tutorials. You don't need to have a deep understanding of the command line to use Ember Theater, but you will need to be able to navigate the folder structure:

* For Linux/Mac users, try the excellent [Code Academy tutorials](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line).
* For Windows users, give the [Lifehacker article](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything) a shot.

## Text Editors

Writing an Ember Theater game means writing code, and your text editor will be your primary tool. These apps are similar to word processors such Microsoft Word or LibreOffice's Writer, but whatever you do, don't use a word processor. It'll make your life much harder, as most word processors will aggressively try to reformat your code and auto-correct your function names. Instead, we encourage you to consider one of the many free and open-source text editors out there. Here are a few popular choice:

* [Atom](https://atom.io/), extremely user-friendly open-source project developed by Github.
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), commercial alternative to Atom with an essentially unending trial period.
* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), a command-line text editor with an unusual, power-user-centric interface. Although hard to master, an experienced user can accomplish far more in it than in other text editors. (The [Vim Adventures](http://vim-adventures.com/) game might make it easier to get started.)

### Navigating an Ember Project

Ember projects can get huge, sometimes containing hundreds or even thousands of files. If you open files one at a time, this can get painful. Instead, try opening your entire Ember project within your text editor. With Atom and Sublime, you can choose the "File > Open Folder" command to do this. With Vim, you'll want to install the [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) plugin.
