## `animate`

When the `animate` text tag is encountered, it changes the way new characters fade in.

```js
this.text(`As this text fades in, it uses the default animation of appearing slightly above
  and to the right, then moving into place. ((#animate { translateX: '-10px', translateY: '10px' }))
  Meanwhile, this text appears from the bottom left.`);
```
