This is a convenient place to store configuration settings for your game, such as the title of the game or what color scheme you prefer. You can then pass the config into your Ember Theater game like so:\n\n```hbs\n{{#ember-theater config=config as |theater|}}\n\n{{/ember-theater}}\n```\n\nThough you'll need to also grab the config in the corresponding controller or component of your template. If `ember-theater` is in your `app/templates/application.hbs` template, then you might do something like this in your `app/controllers/application.js` file:\n\n```js\nimport Ember from 'ember';\nimport config from '../ember-theater/config';\n\nexport default Ember.Controller.extend({\n  config\n});\n```\n\n## Settings\n\nInitially, your `app/ember-theater/config.js` file will look like this:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n\n};\n```\n\nLater, it might look something like this:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  globals: {\n    textSpeed: 20\n  },\n  director: {\n    text: {\n      textSpeed: 30\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, the config is setting both a `globals` text speed, as well as more specific text speed on `director.text`. Now, whenever the `director` plugin uses the `text` direction, it'll use a `textSpeed` of 30. Everything else in your game will use the `globals.textSpeed` of 20. Like this, you can configure your game with both broad and increasingly specific settings.\n","curtain.md":"# Plugin: Curtain\n\nEmber Theater's `curtain` plugin will display a loading graph as the game's assets preload. It will attempt to calculate the total size of all assets and show the player what percentage of the game has been downloaded. Once it completes downloading, it'll trigger `completePreload`.\n\nTo include it in your project, do:\n\n```hbs\n{{#ember-theater as |theater|}}\n  {{#if theater.isLoaded}}\n    {{ember-theater/director\n      theaterId=theater.theaterId\n      initialSceneId=\"we-are-the-best\"\n    }}\n  {{else}}\n    {{ember-theater/curtain\n      theaterId=theater.theaterId\n      filesToPreload=\"backdrops:src expressions:src sounds:src\"\n      completePreload=theater.completePreload\n    }}\n  {{/if}}\n{{/ember-theater}}\n```\n\nYou'll need to pass three arguments into `theater.curtain`:\n\n`theaterId` expected the id of the `ember-theater` instance. In most cases, you'll want to just pass `theater.theaterId` to keep the two in sync.\n\n`filesToPreload` expects a string of fixture/attribute pairs. For instance, `backdrops:src` will grab all the `backdrop` fixtures and download the image that their `src` points to.\n\n`completePreload` expects a callback. In most cases, you'll want to just pass `theater.completePreload` into it, as `theater.completePreload` will set `theater.isLoaded` to `true` when it triggers.\n",director:{"configuration.md":"## Configuration\n\nThere are generally three ways to customize a direction. By passing arguments directly into the direction, by setting attributes on an associated fixture, and finally by changing the config. They are prioritized in this order:\n\n*   Options\n*   Fixtures\n*   Config\n\nSo in this example:\n\n```js\n// app/ember-theater/fixtures/characters.js\n\nexport default [{\n  id: 'bitsy',\n  name: 'Bitsy',\n  classNames: {\n    decorative: ['et-paper']\n  },\n  text: {\n    transitionIn: {\n      effect: { opacity: 0.7 }\n    }\n  }\n}];\n\n// app/ember-theater/config.js\n\nexport default {\n  globals: {\n    transitionIn: {\n      effect: { opacity: 1 },\n      duration: 500\n    }\n  },\n  text: {\n    classNames: {\n      structural: ['et-coastal']\n    },\n    transitionIn: {\n      effect: { opacity: 0.5 },\n      duration: 1000\n    }\n  }\n};\n\n// app/ember-theater/director/scenes/picnic-at-the-beach.js\n\nimport { Scene } from 'ember-theater/ember-theater/director';\n\nexport default Scene.extend({\n  script: async function() {\n    this.Character('bitsy').Text('Hello world!').transitionIn({ opacity: 0.2 });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n`transitionIn: effect` will be set by the options passed to the direction, even though both the fixture and config have declared a value for it. In turn, the `classNames: { decorative }` will be set by the fixture, even though the config has declared a value for it. Finally, `transitionIn: duration` will be set by `config.text`, even though `config.globals` has also declared a value.\n\nYou'll find more details in the individual direction sections on what values can be set in their fixtures/configs.\n",directions:{"backdrop.md":"### `Backdrop(fixture)`\n\nRenders a backdrop on stage, using the transition effect/duration specified in your config or the provided fixture. Alternatively, you can chain commands off of it for a more specific effect.\n\n```js\n// renders the backdrop fixture with the id of 'beach-day'\nthis.Backdrop('beach-day');\n\n// renders a backdrop with the provided attributes\nthis.Backdrop({ id: 'custom-backdrop', src: 'route/to/my/custom.png' });\n```\n\n#### `transition(effect, duration, options)`\n\nCancels the default transition and executes a transition with the provided attributes. Multiple transitions can be chained together, and they'll perform sequentially.\n\nThe `effect` argument can be either a registered [UI-Pack effect](http://julian.com/research/velocity/#uiPack), or an object containing css attributes/values (`{ height: '40px', translateZ: '20vh' }`). If providing an object, you can optionally 'forcefeed' an initial value to its attributes like `{ opacity: [1, 0] }`. Regardless of its actual `opacity`, the animation will start at `0`. This is especially helpful when setting up your scene.\n\nThe `duration` should be in milliseconds.\n\nThe `options` object can set the `easing`, `loop`, or `delay` of the effect. For more info, read the options section of the Velocity.js docs [here](http://julian.com/research/velocity/#easing).\n\nNote: If you aren't familiar with Velocity.js, you can learn all about it [here](http://julian.com/research/velocity). By default, it is the animation engine used by Ember Theater.\n\n```js\n// executes the ui-pack effect 'swoopIn'\nconst beach = this.Backdrop('beach-day').transition('transition.swoopIn');\n\n// fades the backdrop to an opacity of 0.75 over the default duration\nbeach.transition({ opacity: 0.75 });\n\n// fades the backdrop to an opacity of 1, then back to opacity 0.75\nbeach.transition({ opacity: 1 }).transition({ opacity: 0.75});\n\n// fades the backdrop to an opacity of 0.5 over 1000 milliseconds, aka 1 second\nbeach.transition({ opacity: 0.5 }, 1000);\n\n// fades between opacity 0.5 and 1 for 5 iterations\nbeach.transition({ opacity: 1 }, 1000, { loop: 5 });\n\n// skips to opacity 0.5, then fades to opacity 0.2\nbeach.transition({ opacity: [0.2, 0.5] });\n```\n\n#### `stop(queue)`\n\nStops any on-going animations. This is especially useful if you want to cancel a loop.\n\nIf you provide the name of a `queue`, it will stop only that `queue`.\n\n```js\n// slowly fades in a beach backdrop\nconst beach = this.Backdrop('beach-day').transition('transition.fadeIn', 99999999999);\n\n// stops the fade, freezing the backdrop at its current opacity\nbeach.stop();\n\n// infinitely loops between the default translateZ and '20vh'\nbeach.transition({ translateZ: '20vh' }, 500, { loop: true });\n\n// stops the loop, freezing the backdrop at its current translateZ\nbeach.stop();\n\n// begins a transition on a separate queue called 'divergent'\nbeach.transition({ translateX: '20vw' }, 5000, { queue: 'divergent' });\n\n// stops only the 'divergent' queue\nbeach.stop('divergent');\n```\n\n#### `caption(text)`\n\nAlters the `alt` text on the backdrop `img`. By default, the `alt` will be set to the `caption` on the backdrop's fixture. The `caption` command will let you change the `alt` tag for this specific instance of the backdrop.\n\nIn addition to text, you can provide a localization key for internationalized games.\n\nThis functionality is particularly useful for screen-readers, and will provide players who are blind or visually impaired cues about backdrop transitions.\n\n```js\n// renders a beach with its fixture's caption, 'beach during the day'\nconst beach = this.Backdrop('beach-day');\n\n// changes the alt text to 'earthquake on the beach!!!'\nbeach.caption('earthquake on the beach!!!');\n\n// renders a new beach with the custom caption, 'fade into beach scene'\nthis.Backdrop('beach-day').caption('fade into beach scene');\n\n// renders a localized caption, eg:\n// english: 'day at the beach'\n// spanish: 'día en la playa'\nbeach.caption('scenes.picnic-on-the-beach.backdrop-caption');\n```\n","character.md":"### `Character(fixture)`\n\nRenders a character on stage, using the transition effect/duration specified in your config or the provided fixture. Alternatively, you can chain commands off of it for a more specific effect.\n\n```js\n// renders the character fixture with the id of 'bitsy'\nthis.Character('bitsy');\n\n// renders a character with the provided attributes\nthis.Character({ id: 'custom-character', height: 70, defaultExpressionId: 'an-expression-id' });\n```\n\n#### `transition(effect, duration, options)`\n\nCancels the default transition and executes a transition with the provided attributes.

By default, a `Text` will use the name provided by the character fixture, but at times, you might want to replace it with an alternative.\n\nIn addition to text, you can provide a localization key for internationalized games.\n\n```js\nconst bitsy = this.Character('bitsy');\n\n// renders a text box with the name 'Bitsy', as specified in her fixture\nawait bitsy.Text('Uh. . . .');\n\n// sets the character's name to 'Bitsy???'\nbitsy.name('Bitsy???');\n\n// renders a text box with the name 'Bitsy???'\nawait bitsy.Text('Who am I?');\n\n// rends a text box with the name 'Bitsy!'\nawait bitsy.name('Bitsy!').Text('Oh, my name is Bitsy!');\n```\n\n#### `namePosition(namePosition)`\n\nLets you change where the character instance's name appear in a text box. Options are defined in the config under `positions`.\n\n```js\nconst bitsy = this.Character('bitsy');\n\n// renders a text box with the default classes\nawait bitsy.Text('Am I over here?');\n\n// sets the text class name 'name' to et-right\nbitsy.namePosition('right');\n\n// renders a text box with the name in the right position\nawait bitsy.Text('Or over here?');\n```\n","choice.md":"### `choice`\n\n```js\n@param header {String} |optional| A prompt for the choices.\n@param choices {Array} The options available to the user to choose from.\n@param choices.[] {String,Object} Choices can be either a string or an object with the following attributes.\n@param choices.text {String} The text to display to the user.\n@param choices.key {String} The key you expect to get in the promise.\n@param choices.inputable {Boolean} Whether or not the choice should transform into an input field on focus.\n@param [options] {Object} |optional|\n@param [options.instance] {Number} |default: 0| Which instance of the character you wish to alter.\n@param [options.classNames] {Object} |optional|\n@param [options.classNames.decorative] {Array} |optional| CSS decorative classes.\n@param [options.classNames.structural] {Array} |optional| CSS structural classes.\n@param [options.keys] {Object} |optional|\n@param [options.keys.moveUp] {Array} |optional| Keys that move the focus up.\n@param [options.keys.moveDown] {Array} |optional| Keys that move the focus down.\n@param [options.keys.cancel] {Array} |optional| Keys that cancel an inputable choice.\n@param [options.transitionIn] {Object} |optional|\n@param [options.transitionIn.effect] {Object} |default: <set in config>| The effect to use while transitioning in.\n@param [options.transitionIn.duration] {Number} |default: <set in config>| The duration of the transition in effect.\n@param [options.transitionOut] {Object} |optional|\n@param [options.transitionOut.effect] {Object} |default: <set in config>| The effect to use while transitioning out.\n@param [options.transitionOut.duration] {Number} |default: <set in config>| The duration of the transition out effect.\n@param [options.transitionDuration] {Number} |default: <set in config>| Sets the duration of both the transition in and out effect.\n\n@return {Promise} Resolves when a choice has been selected, passing an object with format { key, text, input }\n```\n\nThroughout the game, you might want to present the player with menu-style choices. These choices could range from responses in conversation to multiple choice list of destinations at a bus stop. The `choice` direction presents players with a list of choices and returns a promise containing the value of their choice. The list of choices can be navigated with `ArrowUp` and `ArrowDown` keys, and some choices can be made inputable, so that when they are clicked, they transform into input fields.\n\n```js\n// presents three choices; if the user selects 'B', then the promise will return { key: 1, text: 'B' }\nconst firstChoice = await this.choice(['A', 'B', 'C']);\n// same as above, only with a header\nconst secondChoice = await this.choice('Choose a letter', ['A', 'B', 'C']);\n// same as above, only if the user selects 'B', then the promise will return { key: 'customKey', text: 'B' }\nconst thirdChoice = await this.choice('Choose a letter', ['A', { text: 'B', key: 'customKey' }, 'C']);\n// a choice with custom key bindings\nconst fourthChoice = await this.choice(['Okay', 'Cancel'], { keys: { moveUp: ['a'], moveDown: ['s'] } });\n// if the user selects the third option, it will become an input field; if they enter 'Garnet', then the promise will return { key: 2, text: 'Custom', input: 'Garnet' }\nconst fifthChoice = await this.choice('What is your name?', ['Bitsy', 'Emma', { text: 'Custom', inputable: true }]);\n```\n\n#### Fixture/Config Attributes\n\n```js\n// app/ember-theater/config.js\n\nexport default {\n  globals: {\n    classNames: {\n      decorative: ['et-paper'],\n      structural: ['et-block']\n    },\n    transitionDuration: 1000,\n    keys: {\n      up: ['ArrowUp', 'w'],\n      down: ['ArrowDown', 's'],\n      cancel: ['Escape']\n    },\n    transitionIn: {\n      effect: { opacity: 1 },\n      duration: 1000\n    },\n    transitionOut: {\n      effect: { opacity: 1 },\n      duration: 1000\n    }\n  },\n  choice: {\n    classNames: {\n      decorative: ['et-paper'],\n      structural: ['et-block']\n    },\n    transitionDuration: 1000,\n    keys: {\n      up: ['ArrowUp', 'w'],\n      down: ['ArrowDown', 's'],\n      cancel: ['Escape']\n    },\n    transitionIn: {\n      effect: { opacity: 1 },\n      duration: 1000\n    },\n    transitionOut: {\n      effect: { opacity: 1 },\n      duration: 1000\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n","custom.md":"Content coming soon.\n","delete-data.md":"### `deleteData`\n\n```js\n@param key {String} The key of the data you want to delete.\n```\n\nAfter saving data, you can optionally remove it with `deleteData`:\n\n```js\nthis.deleteData('playerName');\n\nconst playerName = this.getData('playerName'); // playerName === undefined\n```\n","expression.md":"### `expression`\n\n```js\n@param characterId {String} An id corresponding to an `ember-theater/character`.\n@param expressionId {String} An id corresponding to an `ember-theater/expression`.\n@param [options] {Object} |optional|\n@param [options.transitionIn] {Object} |optional| Instructs the transition-in effect.\n@param [options.transitionIn.effect] {Object} |default: { opacity: 1 }| The transition-in effect.\n@param [options.transitionIn.duration] {Number} |default: <set in config>| How long the transition-in effect takes to resolve.\n@param [options.transitionOut] {Object} |optional| Instructs the transition-out effect.\n@param [options.transitionOut.effect] {Object} |default: { opacity: 0 }| The transition-out effect.\n@param [options.transitionOut.duration] {Number} |default: <set in config>| How long the transition-out effect takes to resolve.\n\n@return {Promise} Resolves when the transition-in effect has completed.\n```\n\nCharacters might have many different expressions, ranging from neutral to happy to jumping to wounded.

In Ember Theater, the `director` plugin plays a similar role. While you (the game designer) write a script, the `director` is responsible for translating that script into scenes with lively characters and expressively delivered dialogue.\n\nTo use the `director` in your game, you'll need to:\n\n```hbs\n{{#ember-theater as |theater|}}\n  {{ember-theater/director\n    theaterId=theater.theaterId\n    initialSceneId=\"picnic-on-the-beach\"\n  }}\n{{/ember-theater}}\n```\n\nIf you read over the section on Plugins, then this should look familiar. What will probably look new is that we're passing an argument, `initialSceneId`, into the `director`. That argument is your way of specifying which scene the game should start on. In this case, we'll start the game with the scene entitled `picnic-on-the-beach`. This should refer to a `Scene` with the path `app/ember-theater/director/scenes/picnic-on-the-beach.js`.\n",
"scenes.md":"## Scenes\n\nThe director's job is to keep track of which scene is currently under way, and then to direct the provided `script`. You can generate new scenes by typing `ember g ember-theater-scene [scene-name]` in the command line. Scenes are kept in the folder `app/ember-theater/director/scenes`:\n\n```js\n// app/ember-theater/director/scenes/picnic-on-the-beach.js\n\nimport { Scene } from 'ember-theater/ember-theater/director';\n\nexport default Scene.extend({\n  name: 'The Beach',\n\n  script: async function() {\n    // play the beach theme\n    this.sound('beach-theme', { loop: true });\n    // fadeIn the beach backdrop\n    await this.backdrop('beach-day');\n     // move Bitsy onto the screen, 30% of the screen width from the left\n    this.character('bitsy', { left: '30%' }, { duration: 1000 });\n     // move Emma onto the screen, 30% of the screen width from the right\n    this.character('emma', { left: ['70%', '100%'] }, { duration: 1000 });\n    // Bitsy talks\n    await this.text('bitsy', 'It is so beautiful!');\n    // Emma responds\n    await this.text('emma', 'Uh-huh.');\n\n    // transition to the next scene\n    this.transitionToScene('director/scenes');\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn the `script` above, we see a series of `directions`, such as `sound`, `backdrop`, and `character`. Each of these `directions` will affect what's happening on stage, whether it's the beach scenery fading in or the music starting up.\n\nYou might notice that some of these `directions` take a single argument (such as `this.backdrop('beach');`), while others have two or even three (`this.character('emma', { translateX: '70vw' }, { duration: 500 });`). In the following sections, we'll go into greater detail about how each of these `directions` works.\n\n### Note on `await`\n\nYou might also notice that the script is littered with `await` statements. This experimental ES7 feature will pause the script until the following function has completed. For instance:\n\n```js\nawait this.backdrop('beach');\nthis.character('bitsy', { translateX: '30vw' }, { duration: 500 });\n```\n\nIn this case, `this.character` will not trigger until after `this.backdrop` has finished fading in. If instead we saw:\n\n```js\nthis.backdrop('beach');\nthis.character('bitsy', { translateX: '30vw' }, { duration: 500 });\n```\n\nThen in the above case, the beach would fade in at the same time as the character.\n",styling:{"choice.md":"Content coming soon.\n","index.md":"Content coming soon.\n","text.md":"Content coming soon.\n"},"text-tags":{"animate.md":"### `animate`\n\nWhen the `animate` text tag is encountered, it changes the way new characters fade in.\n\n```js\nthis.text(`As this text fades in, it uses the default animation of appearing slightly above\n  and to the right, then moving into place.

((#close 1000))`)\n```\n","custom.md":"Content coming soon.\n","effect.md":"### `effect`\n\nWhen the `effect` text tag is encountered, it applies an animation to the text box. Note that it accepts two arguments. The first is the effect itself, while the second are options, such as duration and loop. These arguments are seperated with a pipe, `|`.\n\n```js\nthis.text(`This text box will soon be rumbling. ((#effect { rotateZ: 2.5 } | { duration: 100, loop: true }))`);\n\nthis.text(`This text will change color. ((#effect { background-color: 'purple' } | { duration: 100 }))\n  And then it'll change ((#effect { background-color: 'red' })) again!!!`);\n```\n","index.md":"By default, text fades in one character at a time. You can use text tags to alter this behavior, executing special effects the moment in which they're encountered. For instance:\n\n```js\nthis.text(`Hello! Right now, the text is displaying with the default behavior.\n  But ((#speed 20)) now it is going much faster!!! And, you know what? ((#instant))\n  All this text is appearing instantly! No more of this one letter at a time business!\n  ((/instant)) Well, until now. Since we just closed the 'instant' tag, it's back\n  to one letter at a time!`);\n```\n\nIn the example above, we're using two different tag types. (There are many others.) The first, `speed` changes the rate at which new characters fade in. The default is 25 milliseconds, so by decreasing it to 20, new characters are drawn more frequently.\n\nThe second tag in this example does something a bit more interesting. The `instant` tag has both an opening--`((#instant))`--and a closing tag--`((/instant))`. Note that opening tags start with a `#`, while closing tags end with a `/`. Generally, opening tags start behavior, while closing tags end it. Not all text tags support closing tags.\n\nNote that you can always generate your own text tags or use community created alternatives.\n","instant.md":"### `instant`\n\nWhen the `instant` text tag is encountered, it immediately displays all the following text. (No more fade-in, letter-by-letter.) You can optionally provide a closing tag, which will cause text to resume its default fade-in behavior.\n\n```js\nthis.text(`This text is fading in letter-by-letter. ((#instant)) This text appears immediately.`);\n\nthis.text(`((#instant)) This text appear immediately. ((/instant)) This text appears letter-by-letter.`);\n```\n","pause.md":"### `pause`\n\nWhen the `pause` text tag is encountered, it pauses the text. As soon as the player presses a continue key (which ever keys they press to normally advance the text), text will resume printing. It optionally accepts a duration, after which the text will resume printing automatically.\n\n```js\nthis.text(`This text appears normally. ((#pause)) This text won't appear until the player presses the continue key.`);\n\nthis.text(`((#pause 1000)) The pause will automatically resolve after 1000 milliseconds.\nAlternatively, if the player presses the continue key, it'll resolve as normal.`);\n```\n","speed.md":"### `speed`\n\nWhen the `speed` text tag is encountered, it changes the rate at which letters are printed. If the provided speed starts with a '*', it'll multiply the speed by the following number. Note that lower numbers are faster, so multiply by a fraction (eg, `0.5`) to make the text go faster.\n\n```js\nthis.text(`This text appears at the normal rate of a new character every 25 milliseconds.\n  ((#speed 20)) This text appears at the faster rate of every 20 milliseconds.\n  ((#speed 40)) This text appears at the much slower rate of every 40 milliseconds.`);\n\nthis.text(`This text appears at the normal rate of a new character every 25 milliseconds.\n  ((#speed *0.5)) This text appears at the faster rate of every 12.5 milliseconds.\n  ((#speed *2)) This text appears at the normal rate of every 25 milliseconds.\n  ((#speed *2)) This text appears at the much slower rate of every 40 milliseconds`);\n```\n"}},"fixtures.md":"# Fixtures\n\n## Overview\n\nSome games won't need to use fixtures, but most will find them useful. Fixtures are a simple way to define reoccurring game elements, such as characters or backdrops. For instance, consider these character fixtures:\n\n```js\nexport default [{\n  id: 'bitsy',\n  name: 'Bitsy Robotica',\n  height: 60,\n  defaultExpression: 'bitsy-standing'\n}, {\n  id: 'blx',\n  name: 'Emma',\n  height: 80,\n  defaultExpression: 'emma-smirk'\n}];\n```\n\nHere, two characters are defined, each with an unique `id` followed by several attributes. You'll now be able to utilize all those attributes by simply giving Ember Theater the associated `id`:\n\n```js\nexport default Scene.extend({\n  script() {\n    this.Character('bitsy').position('center').Text('Hi! My name is Bitsy!');\n  }\n});\n```\n\nSince you've already defined the fixture 'bitsy', Ember Theater knows that it should display her with the default expression of 'bitsy-standing' and that she should be 60% of the screen's height.\n\nMany Ember Theater directions have fixtures associated with them, and some fixture types (such as `characters`), are associated with multiple directions. You'll find out more about the fixture attributes a given direction expects in the docs for that direction.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo include fixtures, simply pass them into the `ember-theater` component. For instance:\n\n```hbs\n{{#ember-theater fixtures=fixtures as |theater|}}\n\n{{/ember-theater}}\n```\n\nYou'll need to also define these fixtures in the corresponding controller or component. If `ember-theater` is in your `app/templates/application.hbs` template, then you might do something like this in your `app/controllers/application.js` file:\n\n```js\nimport Ember from 'ember';\nimport backdrops from '../ember-theater/fixtures/backdrops';\nimport characters from '../ember-theater/fixtures/characters';\nimport expressions from '../ember-theater/fixtures/expressions';\nimport sounds from '../ember-theater/fixtures/sounds';\n\nexport default Ember.Controller.extend({\n  fixtures: {\n    backdrops,\n    characters,\n    expressions,\n    sounds\n  }\n});\n```\n","index.md":"# Ember Theater\n\nWelcome to Ember Theater!

We wrote these docs to be as approachable as possible, but there's also a wealth of information for those who wish to dive deeper and get the most out of the Ember Theater game engine.\n",installation:{"helpful-links.md":"## Using the Command line\n\nIf you've never used the command line before (or you need a refresher), you might want to check out one of these tutorials. You don't need to have a deep understanding of the command line to use Ember Theater, but you will need to be able to navigate the folder structure:\n\n* For Linux/Mac users, try the excellent [Code Academy tutorials](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line).\n* For Windows users, give the [Lifehacker article](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything) a shot.\n\n## Text Editors\n\nWriting an Ember Theater game means writing code, and your text editor will be your primary tool. These apps are similar to word processors such Microsoft Word or LibreOffice's Writer, but whatever you do, don't use a word processor. It'll make your life much harder, as most word processors will aggressively try to reformat your code and auto-correct your function names. Instead, we encourage you to consider one of the many free and open-source text editors out there. Here are a few popular choice:\n\n* [Atom](https://atom.io/), extremely user-friendly open-source project developed by Github.\n* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), commercial alternative to Atom with an essentially unending trial period.\n* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), a command-line text editor with an unusual, power-user-centric interface. Although hard to master, an experienced user can accomplish far more in it than in other text editors. (The [Vim Adventures](http://vim-adventures.com/) game might make it easier to get started.)\n\n### Navigating an Ember Project\n\nEmber projects can get huge, sometimes containing hundreds or even thousands of files. If you open files one at a time, this can get painful. Instead, try opening your entire Ember project within your text editor. With Atom and Sublime, you can choose the \"File > Open Folder\" command to do this. With Vim, you'll want to install the [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) plugin.\n","index.md":"## For New Developers\n\nBefore continuing with the steps below, you might want to check out the \"Helpful Links\" section in the sidebar. That section will help you get oriented with the command line, text editors, and the tools you'll be using when coding an Ember Theater game. If you're already comfortable with all those things, then feel free to skip that section and get straight to setup.\n\n### A Word of Encouragement\n\nGetting Ember Theater setup can be a big process, and if you've never worked with the command line before, it'll also require you to interface with your computer in a new and challenging way. The upswing is that Ember Theater is built with incredibly powerful tools, and it extends that power to make game design that much easier for you. Although the setup might be daunting, bear with it and you'll have a simple, extensible, and highly customizable game engine at your disposal.\n\n## Creating an Ember Project\n\nBefore starting your first Ember Theater project, you'll need to ensure that you have Ember CLI installed. You can find an excellent guide [here](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.3.0/getting-started/). This will likely be the lengthiest part of your setup, but once you have Ember CLI on your machine, you'll be able to use it to make countless Ember Theater games.\n\nTo start a project, simply enter `ember new [project name]` in your terminal.\n\n## Installing the Ember Theater addon\n\nWithin your project folder, type `ember install ember-theater`. NPM will now start downloading Ember Theater. This can take a few minutes.\n\nWhile the addon is installing, you can complete the next steps. First, we'll want to enable advanced ES7 features like async functions. To do so, navigate to `ember-cli-build.js` and modify `EmberApp` to include these lines:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function(defaults) {\n  var app = new EmberApp(defaults, {\n    babel: {\n      includePolyfill: true,\n      stage: 1\n    }\n  });\n\n  . . . .\n\n}\n```\n\nNext, we'll need to ensure that we're using the same pod structure as Ember Theater. (When pods 2.0 come out, this step should no longer be necessary.) Go to `config/environment.js` and add a `podModulePrefex` to `ENV`. The `podModulePrefex` should be identical to your `modulePrefex` (also found in this file), but with `/pods` appended to the end, like so:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function(environment) {\n  var ENV = {\n    modulePrefix: 'my-game',\n    podModulePrefix: 'my-game/pods',\n\n    . . . .\n  }\n};\n```\n\nNext, go to `bower.json` and ensure that `ember` is at 2.3.0 or higher. If not, change it to at least 2.3.0 and then run `bower install` in your command line.\n\n## Using Ember Theater\n\nNow that you have Ember Theater and its dependencies installed, you're ready to include it in your Ember project. To do so, you'll reference it in one of your `.hbs` templates. The easiest way to get this up and running is to navigate to `app/templates/application.hbs` and then replace the contents of that file with:\n\n```hbs\n{{#ember-theater as |theater|}}\n\n{{/ember-theater}}\n```\n\nAnd there you have it! You have Ember Theater in your project. Now you just need to include one of the plugins to see it in action.\n\n## Using Ember Theater styles\n\nFirst, you'll have to make sure you're using Sass. Run `ember install ember-cli-sass` in your command line.\n\nNext, replace `app/styles/app.css` with `app/styles/app.scss`. Inside of `app.scss`, paste:\n\n```scss\n@import \"ember-theater/ember-theater\";\n```\n\n## Running the dev environment\n\nOnce you have the Ember project setup, you can start the dev environment by running `ember server` in your command line. After that, navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to see the game in action. (Note that it'll just be a blank screen until you include an Ember Theater plugin.)\n"},"menu-bar":{"configuration.md":"## Configuration\n\nYou can configure the key bindings that activate the various buttons:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  menuBar: {\n    load: {\n      keys: {\n        open: ['ctrl+l']\n      }\n    },\n    reset: {\n      keys: {\n        open: ['ctrl+r']\n      }\n    },\n    rewind: {\n      keys: {\n        open: ['ctrl+b']\n      }\n    },\n    save: {\n      keys: {\n        open: ['ctrl+s']\n      }\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n","index.md":"The menu bar is a place for you to add meta-actions to your game, such as saving, loading, and reseting.

You'll find the documentation to each in the table of contents.\n","preloader.md":"## Preloaders\n\nDue to the nature of the web, images, music, and other files aren't downloaded until a website uses them--which is to say, a song won't start downloading until it starts playing. This can lead to poor performance over slower connections, especially in an Ember Theater game which might require the browser to load dozens of large files at the same time.\n\nTo work around this, Ember Theater lets you preload your game's large files. You can use the `ember-theater/curtain` preloader to do this, or you can create one of your own. Like all plugins, you include a preloader in your `hbs`:\n\n```hbs\n{{#ember-theater as |theater|}}\n  {{#if theater.isLoaded}}\n    {{ember-theater/director\n      theaterId=theater.theaterId\n      initialSceneId=\"we-are-the-best\"\n    }}\n  {{else}}\n    {{ember-theater/curtain\n      theaterId=theater.theaterId\n      filesToPreload=\"backdrops:src expressions:src sounds:src\"\n      completePreload=theater.completePreload\n    }}\n  {{/if}}\n{{/ember-theater}}\n```\n\n`theater.isLoaded` won't be true until all the files have been preloaded, which means that the `director` will remain hidden. Once the files are preloaded, the `curtain` will disappear and the `director` will take the stage. You'll find more information on the `curtain` preloader in its section on the sidebar.\n"}}}}}),define("ember-theater-web/ember-theater/config",["exports"],function(e){e["default"]={plugins:[],mediaLoader:{type:"",filesToPreload:[]}}}),define("ember-theater-web/ember-theater/director/directions/backdrop",["exports","ember-theater/ember-theater/director/directions/backdrop"],function(e,t){Object.defineProperty(e,"default",{enumerable:!0,get:function(){return
